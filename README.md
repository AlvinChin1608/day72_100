# Data Exploration with Pandas
I recently delved into data analysis and manipulation using the powerful pandas library in Python. My focus was on understanding how to effectively use pandas to clean, analyse, and summarise data.

## Key Learnings:

### Grouping and Aggregation:
- Utilised groupby() to segment the data by specific categories (e.g., grouping university majors) and applied aggregation functions like mean() to gain insights into average values across groups.
- Learned how to handle common issues during aggregation, such as ensuring numeric data types and dealing with NaN values.

### Data Formatting:
- Customised the display of floating-point numbers to improve the readability of outputs, using pd.options.display.float_format to format numerical outputs consistently with two decimal places.

### Data Cleaning:
- Addressed potential data issues such as non-numeric columns in calculations and handled missing data by either filling NaN values or dropping rows as needed.

### Practical Application:
- Applied these techniques to a dataset of university majors, exploring trends and patterns in the data. This included calculating mean values for different groups, summarising data, and preparing it for further analysis.

This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of pandas and reinforced my skills in data analysis and manipulation. Moving forward, I plan to continue exploring more advanced features of pandas and integrate this knowledge into larger data projects.
